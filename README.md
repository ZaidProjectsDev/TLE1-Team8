# Assets
This project uses YoloV5 (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

# Installation 
!!!You need to be on Python 3.11.6 or under for the moment because Torch doesn't support Python 3.12 right now. 

Please run pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade to install all dependencies (You might need to do this in an admin CMD if there's an error)

# Running the program
For now run the windowcapture by using : python window_Capture/main.py
